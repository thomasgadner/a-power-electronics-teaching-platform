# Modular Power Converter Teaching Platform {.unnumbered}


This is a manual to the "Modular Power Converter Teaching Platform" which can be used to create up to 20+ different Converter topologies with a combination of the modules. These modules are separated in Input-, Switching-, Transformer-, Passive-, Microcontroller- and Output- Modul. The following documentation describes the individual parts and how to combine them.

The Modular Power Converter Teaching Platform was designed by Oskar Klöpfer under the supervision of Thomas Gadner in his Bachelor Thesis @BA_kloepfer. Most of the content in this user manual comes from this Bachelor Thesis. A second version of the PCB design was carried out by Tobias Stummer. The manual was written by Christian Moser.


## General Overview

@fig-buck_example is an example of the modular setup of a buck converter. Following modules are used for this setup: Input-> Half-bridge -> LC-Filter -> Output.

Each module is described in the following chapters starting with @sec-in_out. A number of possible combinations of these modules are described in @sec-combination to create different converter topologies. The modules are connected via header pins on top and bottom of the module. The inputs of each module are the called $J1$ and $J2$ and the outputs are called $P1$ and $P2$. Each module has solderbridges to connect the individual parts on the board to get the desired converter topologie.

## Important Note
The maximum input power is limited to $100\,\text{W}$  to cover typical low-voltage applications. The input voltage range is adjustable from $10\,\text{V}$ to $50\,\text{V}$, with lower voltages limiting the transferable power due to the $5\,\text{A}$ input current limit.
