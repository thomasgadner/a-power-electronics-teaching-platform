# Input & Output Module {#sec-in_out}

The Input and Output Module forms the central connection point between the converter and the outside world.

## Input Module

The Input Module (@fig-input-module) provides three separate connection channels $V1$,$V2$ and $V3$. For most applications - e.g., DC power supplies or single-phase inverter - two input channels are sufficient. $V3$ is intended for topologies that require three-phase power, such as three-phase rectifiers.

The Input Module also includes the two terminals $VCC$ and $GND$. These should be connected to a $5\,\text{V}$ power supply that is used by components requiring an external operating voltage, for example the measurement circuits on the Passive Module or the gate-driver supply on the Switching Module.

## Output Module

The Output Module (@fig-output-module) also provides three connection channels like the Input Module. This module is typically added at the end of the modular built to connect loads. 
Both modules include an optional mounting area for an electrolytic capacitor ($C_{ELKO}$), which acts as a DC-link capacitor for the input voltage or as a filtering capacitor for the output voltage. The component for this footprint can be found on [Würth Elektronics](https://www.we-online.com/en/components/products/pbs/capacitors/aluminium_electrolytic_capacitors/aluminum_electrolytic_v-chip_smt_capacitors){target="_blank"}
