## Transformer Module {#sec-trans}

The transformer module has two transformers on it to design different topologies. Footprint $T1$ is for a [flexible Transformer](https://www.we-online.com/en/components/products/WE-FLEX#749196500){target="_blank"} with six windings and a turn ratio of 1:1. This one is used for all kind of switching regulators. E.g. flyback-, forward- and push-pull converter. The topologie for this transformer can be seen in @fig-flyback and @fig-pushpull. In both scetches is the same transformer, it is split up in two for readability.

Footprint $T2$ on the other hand is a transformer for high frequency purposes like LLC- converter or Dual active bridge. As can be seen in @fig-llc_dab it has also additional inductances possible in series or parallel to the input-side of the transformer. The used transformer is [WE-PLN Planar Transformer ER19/4.8/15](https://www.we-online.com/en/components/products/WE-PLN#/articles/WE-PLN-ER19_4_8_15){target="_blank"}.
